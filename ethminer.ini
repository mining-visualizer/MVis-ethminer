[0xBitcoin]

; Your ETH account and private key.  Note the acct starts with 0x, but

; when your miner finds a solution, transactions will be submitted with this 
; amount of gas (gwei).  You can change this setting 'on the fly' (without having
; to restart the miner).  All other setting changes require the miner to be restarted.
GasPrice=5

; Set to 1 to enable gas price bidding.  Transactions will be submitted
; with [GasPrice] gas, unless there is someone else bidding, in which case
; the gas price will be set to the price of the competing bid + [BidTop], up
; to a maximum of [MaxGasPrice]. This feature has only been tested when running
; Geth as a local node.  It is NOT supported by Infura nodes.
GasPriceBidding=0

; max gas price you're willing to bid up to
MaxGasPrice=35

; the # of gwei to top the highest bidder
BidTop=2

; if you have multiple mining rigs, specify a shared folder to make sure
; multiple miners don't try to submit a solution for the same challenge.
; eg. ChallengeFolder=\\DESKTOP\folder_name

[ThermalProtection]

; Temperature provider ('amd_adl' or 'speedfan')
TempProvider=amd_adl

; Default temperature at which GPU throttling is activated. This applies to all GPUs on this mining rig.
; Note: throttling is at the hashing level, not the driver level.
ThrottleTemp=80

; Number of seconds after which the entire mining rig will shutdown if one or more GPUs
; remain at or above ThrottleTemp.
